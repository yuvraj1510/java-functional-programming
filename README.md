Functional programming is a paradigm that allows programming using expressions i.e. declaring functions, passing functions as arguments and using functions as statements.

## Implementations using Structural Programming
* [Print each element from list in its own line](src/main/java/com/ysingh/structure/ST01PrintListElement.java)
* [Print courses, courses having name with Spring, courses having name greater than 3 characters](src/main/java/com/ysingh/structure/ST02CourseExcerise.java)
* [Print Square of each number in the list](src/main/java/com/ysingh/structure/ST03PrintSquareOfEachListElement.java)

## Implementations using Functional Programming
### Using Streams, Filters and Lambdas:
* [Print each element from list in its own line](/src/main/java/com/ysingh/functional/FP01PrintListElement.java)
* [Print courses, courses having name with Spring, courses having name greater than 3 characters](src/main/java/com/ysingh/functional/FP02CourseExcerise.java)
### Using Map:
* [Print Square of each number in the list](src/main/java/com/ysingh/functional/FP03PrintSquareOfEachListElement.java)
