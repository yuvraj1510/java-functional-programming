# java-functional-programming
Functional programming is a paradigm that allows programming using expressions i.e. declaring functions, passing functions as arguments and using functions as statements.

## Implementations using Structural Programming
* [Print each element from list in its own line](src/main/java/com/ysingh/structure/ST01PrintListElement.java)
* [Print courses, courses having name with Spring, courses having name greater than 3 characters](src/main/java/com/ysingh/structure/ST02CourseExcerise.java)
* [Print Square of each number in the list](src/main/java/com/ysingh/structure/ST03PrintSquareOfEachListElement.java)
* [Print sum of all elements in the list](src/main/java/com/ysingh/structure/ST04AddNumbersInList.java)
* [Print max and min number from all elements in the list](src/main/java/com/ysingh/structure/ST05MaximumAndMinimumNumberInList.java)
* [Square every number in the list and find the sum of squares](src/main/java/com/ysingh/structure/ST06Excersise.java)
* [Cube every number in the list and find the sum of cubes](src/main/java/com/ysingh/structure/ST06Excersise.java)
* [Find sum of odd numbers in the list](src/main/java/com/ysingh/structure/ST06Excersise.java)
* [Print distinct numbers in the list](src/main/java/com/ysingh/structure/ST07DistinctAndSorted.java)
* [Sort list of numbers and print it](src/main/java/com/ysingh/structure/ST07DistinctAndSorted.java)
* [Sort list of strings and print it](src/main/java/com/ysingh/structure/ST07DistinctAndSorted.java)

## Implementations using Functional Programming
### Using Streams, Filters and Lambdas:
* [Print each element from list in its own line](/src/main/java/com/ysingh/functional/FP01PrintListElement.java)
